        <div class="title">Find the word <a onclick="fakebnana()">banana</a></div>
        <div class="waldo">I am going to do it. I have made up my mind. 
            These are the first few words of the new‚Ä¶ the best ‚Ä¶ the Longest Text In The Entire 
            History Of The Known Universe! This Has To Have Over 35,000 words the beat the current 
            world record set by that person who made that flaming chicken handbooky thingy. 
            I might just be saying random things the whole time I type in this so you might get
            confused a lot. I just discovered something terrible. autocorrect is on!! no!!!
            this has to be crazy, so I will have to break all the English language rules and the
            basic knowledge of the average human being. I am not an average human being, however 
            I am special. no no no, not THAT kind of special ;). Why do people send that wink face! 
            it always gives me nightmares! it can make a completely normal sentence creepy. 
            imagine you are going to a friend‚Äôs house, so you text this: [ see you soon üôÇ ] 
            seems normal, right? But what is you add the word semi to that colon? (Is that right? 
            or is it the other way around) what is you add a lorry to that briquettes? 
            (Semi-truck to that coal-on) anyway, back to the point: [ see you soon üòâ ]THAT IS JUST 
            SO CREEPY! is that really your friend, or is it a creepy stalker watching your every 
            move? Or even worse, is it your friend who is a creepy stalker? maybe you thought 
            it was your friend, but it was actually your fri end (let me explain: you are happily 
            in McDonalds, getting fat while eating yummy food and some random dude walks up and 
            blots out the sun (he looks like a regular here) you can‚Äôt see anything else than him, 
            so you can‚Äôt try to avoid eye contact. he finishes eating his cheeseburger 
            you‚Äôve never met him before but he looks like he could be in 
            some weird cult. he clears his throat and asks you a very personal question. ‚Äúcan 
            i have some French fries?‚Äù (I don‚Äôt know why there called French fries when I‚Äôve 
            never seen a French person eat fries! all they eat it is stuff like baguettes and 
            cr√™pes and rats named ratty-two-ee which is a really fun game on the PlayStation 2) 
            And you think {bubbly cloud thinking bubble} ‚ÄúHahahahahhahahahahahahahaha!!!!!!!!!!!! 
            Hehheheheheh‚Ä¶..heeeheehe..hehe‚Ä¶ sigh. I remember that i was just about to eat one of 
            my fries when I noticed something mushy and moist and [insert gross color like green a
            friend, not a fri end)and all Joe does is watch sports like 
            football with bob and all bob does is gamble ferociously (don‚Äôt ask(it means he buys 
            all those bags of chips that say ‚Äúwin a free monkey or something if you find a <a onclick="b1()">banana</a> 
            in your bag*‚Äù(if there is a little star it means there is fine print so I always 
            check the back of the package) *flips over the package* okay, it says: ‚Äúone of our 
            workers accidentally threw a<a onclick="b2()"> banana</a> in the packing machine and we don‚Äôt want to get 
            sued so we did this promotion thing‚Äù cool. Oh wow, this is salt and vinegar! my 
            favourite! i hate cheese and onion.))and that‚Äôs pretty much his life, he lives in 
            Jamaica with Naruto and his friends) so you give him that gross fri end he throws up 
            all over you and me and the worker behind the counter who was still making an onion, 
            and THAT is the story of the fri end, not a friend who somehow remembered your name and 
            your phone number / email so he could text you saying he would come to your house soon. 
            *finally takes a breath after typing a few hundred words about fri-ends* so what now? i 
            know, i know, you think i ramble too much and use too many brackets (i don‚Äôt) but now i 
            am going to talk about my amAZEing day. first i woke up, ate choco pops for breakfast 
            even tho i always hate it when people say that cause i get jealous and super hungry. 
            then i‚Ä¶ umm‚Ä¶ yea! that was my day. you know that other person i mentioned before? that 
            flaming chicken person? WELL. 
            i will steal something from that person but do it better. i will‚Ä¶ drum roll please ‚Ä¶</div>
